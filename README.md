## About
This repository contains my implementations of various data structures and algorithms, created as part of my learning journey in computer science and software development. Each project focuses on solving specific problems efficiently while maintaining clean and well-documented code.

## Projects

### 1. Big Integer Implementation
- Location: `/bigInt/`
- Implementation of arbitrary-precision integer arithmetic
- Supports basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division

### 2. Huffman Coding
- Location: `/huffmanCoding/`
- Implementation of Huffman's algorithm for lossless data compression
- Includes both encoding and decoding functionality

### 3. Flight Scheduler
- Location: `/flightScheduled/`
- Application for managing and scheduling flights
- Implements graph algorithms for route optimization

### 4 . Viua

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- CMake (for build management)
